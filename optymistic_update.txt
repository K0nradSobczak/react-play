Our use mutate has one more parameter onMutate there we set something what happens before mutation 

With these we should copy everything from onSuccess and past it into onMutate

In onSuccess we have to replace newTodo with saved ToDo from backend by map method

And add onError: which has two parameters error,newDTO, and previousDTO

We have to store previous DTO using our client.getQueryData and set interface with context
